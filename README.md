# Anonymous Proxy 

It is a landing page where I practice semantic tags of html, css and sass, flexbox, grid, partials. 

It consists of:  
 - A first part in which we have an image and a navigation button. 

 - Then we find a section with a brief description and a button that takes us to the last part of the page.

 - Later we have a second section consisting of three blocks and a button.

 - Finally a footer with different social networks and a small button that takes us to the top of the page. 


## Why this project even exist?

It comes from an Adalab exercise of module 1, in which they evaluate my knowledge acquired in this first module of layout.
